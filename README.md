# FindEx-MAD

###About Find-Ex

###Problem we are trying to solve.

Students tend to lose their personal belongings when they are on campus.

The lack of a centralized database forces the student to go around the campus to each and every 
lost and found department and look for their item.

The time and effort in this process is really exhausting and does not garantees that the student will end up getting his/her lost item.

### Solution we propose.
 
 The Students can look for the lost item on campus using the FindEx Mobile Application.
 The student will get the location along with the Maps of the exact location of the department which is holding that item.
 
 This makes the process really easy for students as well as the University.
